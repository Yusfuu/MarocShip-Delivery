### Scripts

All the different build steps are orchestrated via [yarn scripts](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/run/).
Yarn scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via yarn.

| Yarn Script | Description                                                                     |

| `build`     | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks                                                |
| `dev`       | Runs full build before starting all watch tasks. Can be invoked with `yarn dev` |
| `test`      | run units tests using [jest](https://jestjs.io/)                                |
| `kill`      | stop servers                                                                    |
